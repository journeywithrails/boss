Application Configuration
=========================

Application Configuration is stored in config/application.yml.

This file is expected to contain a 'common' key and a key for each environment 
('development', 'test', 'production', etc.) a t the top level. At load time,
this config file is loaded into an open struct with the relevant dictionary for
the current environment merged into common and stored in a global constant
::AppConfig.

Since the yaml file is recursively parsed into an OpenStruct, values can be
nested arbitrarily and are referred to by dot-path: 

    ::AppConfig.my_group.my_sub_group.my_setting
