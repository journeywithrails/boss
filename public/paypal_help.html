    <h3>PayPal Usage Disclosure</h3>
      In order to process and receive a payment through PayPal:
      <ul>
        <li>The party receiving the payment must establish
        a PayPal account from PayPal.</li>
        <li>The party making the payment might be required to have a PayPal account before a payment can be made</li>
        <li>PayPal charges a per transaction fee for the user of their services</li>
        <li>Billing Boss does not record the payment automatically in Billing Boss once the payment is made. You can record it manually by locating the invoice and mark it as paid by PayPal.</li>
      </ul>
      Integration with PayPal is a service provided for the convenience of 
      our Billing Boss customers. Sage does not endorse the use of PayPal nor
      does Sage receive any monetary benefits from PayPal.
