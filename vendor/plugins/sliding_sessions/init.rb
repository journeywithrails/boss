module SlidingSessions
  # Allows using :session_expires_after option for session cookies
  # NOTE it does not perform any checks on server-side, it just
  # sets the session cookie expiration time.
  # see http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtoChangeSessionOptions
  # for a recipe to perform server-side expiration checks
